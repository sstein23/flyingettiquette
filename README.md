## Why do I find this dataset interesting?
I found this dataset interesting because in examining flying norms, it created a **microcosm** of reality. Through this, I can find out what's different about how people interact on planes, and what might be more similar to real life, but harder to encapsulate.

## Why did I choose this specific data around rudeness and talking to strangers?
I chose this **specific** data because it contrast two different values of "stranger danger" and politeness and how people are inherently social beings. I thought that this data might reflect how the proximity of an airplane can change social interaction or allow a closeness and politeness that wasn't there before. 

## What does this chart show?
I think this chart shows that generally a lot of people find it okay to talk to people next to them on an airplane, and not incredibly rude. Of course this does lead me to question why some other respondents did indicate that it was rude and wonder why.
